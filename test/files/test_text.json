  "Microbial behavior in landfill solid waste and raw milk production. This synthetic project explores microbial adaptations in sanitary landfill refuse, focusing on arsenate reduction pathways, and compares them with bacterial communities found in cow milk from alpine and lowland farms. Results provide insights into engineered systems that span waste treatment and food production environments.",
  "Hyperuricemia gut microbiota and cow milk microbial comparison. This study examines changes in the full digestive tract flora of mice during hyperuricemia occurrence and remission, alongside bacterial profiling of raw cow milk from distinct rearing conditions. Findings highlight shared taxa that may influence host metabolism and dairy product safety.",
  "Switchgrass soil-root microbiomes and human intestinal communities. We explored bacterial diversity in deep soil-root cores under switchgrass cultivation and compared it to human gut microbiota in individuals with intestinal pathology. This cross-ecosystem perspective reveals how agricultural and host-associated environments share functional microbial traits.",
  "Airborne bacteria from gucheng and marine microbiota in the south china sea. This project examines summer airborne bacterial communities collected at gucheng station and compares them to marine microbial assemblages from the northeast south china sea. Results shed light on microbial dispersal and diversity across atmospheric and aquatic habitats."
